This repository contains the source code accompanying Analog Labs' (AL) DIY kit, [How to Build an e-Reader](https://www.analog.earth). The e-Reader displays user-defined text on a low-energy e-Paper display and lets the user toggle pages using keys on the keyboard.

## Components
The e-Reader can be assembling using the following components:

1. Raspberry Pi (RPI)
2. e-ink display
3. Micro-SD card running Raspbian or another Linux-based OS that supports ARM7 architecture.
4. Power cable
5. This source code

The e-Reader kit can also be purchased ready to use out-of-the-box from [Analog Labs](https://www.analog.earth). Each kit comes with an illustrated, narrative-based instruction guide  on how to assemble your own e-Reader and use it to read George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*.
